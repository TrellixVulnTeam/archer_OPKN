# Archer 

Archer was an Ansible playbook for provisioning a machine running Arch Linux. It
is no longer supported or maintained, but forking this project or using it as a
foundation for your own playbook(s) is encouraged -- however, please be sure to
update the dependencies, as these will change over time and critical updates may
be necessary to avoid vulnerabilities.
